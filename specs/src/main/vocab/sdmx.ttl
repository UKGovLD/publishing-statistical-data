# --- Note ---------------------------

# In the revised structure, as developed at ODaF2010, the core representation
# of multidimensional data is covered by a general purpose "data cube" vocabulary.

# This SDMX-RDF vocabulary is now an extension to the Data Cube core to cover
# notions specific to aggregate statistical information as modelled in SDMX.

# The current version just covers the representation of Concept Roles.
# Future work will develop the SDMX vocabulary in more detail, based upon 
# the earlier SDMX-RDF draft.
