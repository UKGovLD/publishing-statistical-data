<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
Statistical data underpins many of the mash-ups and visualisations
we see on the web, as well as being the foundations for policy
prediction, planning and adjustments. The SDMX standard for
exchanging statistical data is used by U.S. Federal Reserve
Board, the European Central Bank, Eurostat, the WHO, the IMF,
and the World Bank; the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) and the UN expect the publishers of
national statistics to use SDMX to allow aggregation across
national boundaries. 
</p>

<p>
SDMX is not web-friendly. The concepts, code lists, datasets,
and observations are not named with URIs or routinely exposed
to browsers and other web-crawlers. This makes it more difficult 
for third parties to annotate, reference, and discover that data.
Nor is SDMX the only shape in which statistical data is published;
data is available in specialist XML formats such as LGDx,
de-facto semi-standards like CSV, and proprietary application
formats like Excel spreadsheets or PDF documents.</p>

<p>RDF provides a mechanism for data publishing on the web which, through 
the use of <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">linked data</a> principles, 
supports easy discovery
and cross-linking of published data. RDF is a simple but flexible
representation in which logical statements (binary predicates) are asserted
about resources. The resources, classes of resources and predicates are 
identified by URIs thus supporting web-based discovery of the associated information
model.</p>

<p>There are a number of benefits to being able to publish statistical
data using RDF:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The individual observations, and groups of observations, become (web) addressable. 
  This allows third party annotations and linking; for example a report can reference 
  the specific figures it is based on allowing for fine grained provenance trace-back.</li>
  
  <li>Flexible combination of data across datasets, this extends to combination 
  between statistical and non-statistical sets within the linked data web (for 
  example <em>find all Religious schools in census areas with high values for National 
  Indicators pertaining to religious tolerance</em>). The statistical data becomes an 
  integral part of the broader web of linked data.</li>	
  
  <li>The ability to slice and dice the datasets in new ways, due to the 
  fine grained representation enabled by the linked data approach.</li>
  
  <li>For publishers who currently only offer static files then publishing 
  as linked-data offers a flexible, non-proprietary, machine readable means of 
  publication that supports an out-of-the-box web API for programmatic access.</li>
</ul>

<p>SDMX-RDF is an RDF <em>vocabulary</em> designed to support this. It defines
classes and predicates to represent statistical data within RDF, compatible
with the SDMX information model.</p>

<p>SDMX-RDF makes use of the following existing RDF vocabularies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a> for ItemSchemes</li>
  <li><a href="http://sw.joanneum.at/scovo/schema.html">SCOVO</a> for core statistical structures</li>
  <li><a href="http://rdfs.org/ns/void-guide">VoiD</a> for data access (instead of SDMX registries)</li>
  <li><a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF</a> for organisations</li>
  <li><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">Dublin Core Terms</a> for metadata</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="characterizing">1.1 Characterizing statistical data</h3>

<p>A statistical data set comprises a collection of observations made 
at some points across a logical space. For example statistics for monitoring 
government performance typically comprise some set of indicators (e.g. economic activity,
health) measured at particular times, across some set of geographic regions and 
population samples. The data set can be characterized by a set of dimensions
which define what the observation applies to (time, area, population) and the 
observations themselves form a <em>hypercube</em> or <em>multi-dimensional space</em> indexed by those dimensions.
In addition, the data set needs to convey, directly or indirectly, how to
interpret those observations - attributes defining units of measurement, scale etc -
along with metadata to support discovery and provide context to the data. 
The defining feature of such statistical datasets is this regular structure
of dimensions and attributes around which the observations are grouped.</p>

<p>Many approaches to representing statistical data follow this hypercube model
and individual observations can only be located and interpreted via their
address within a fixed surrounding cube. This approach is convenient for storage and 
manipulation of a single data set.</p>

<p>However, when we wish to arbitrarily combine datasets, to annotate and track
provenance of individual observations or arbitrary subsets of observations, to
link observations to non-statistical datasets we need a different approach.
We need to represent each observation as a separate entity which has an
observed value along with its attributes and location within the
multi-dimensional space. This is the approach taken in SDMX-RDF, which in
turn is based on the earlier [SCOVO] model. </p>

<h3>1.2 RDF and Linked Data</h3>

<p><em>Linked data</em> is an approach to publication of data on the web.
It is a set of best practices to enable systems to use the Web to connect
related data that wasn't previously linked, or lower the barriers 
to linking data currently linked using other methods. The approach [@@ref] recommends
use of HTTP URIs to name the entities and concepts so that consumers of the data can 
lookup those URIs to get more information, including links to other related URIs.
RDF [@@ref] provides a standard for the representation of the information that 
describes those entities and concepts, and is returned by dereferencing the URIs.  
</p>

<p>When applied to statistical data this linked data approach implies
identifying datasets, time series and individual observations by means of HTTP URIs. 
These then enable both publishers and third parties to annotate and reference
statistical data on the web, which helps to build trust with those
engaging in conversations about the data. Using the RDF data
model enables consumers to query statistical data in standard
ways and to enhance statistical data by mixing it with other linked
data.</p>

<h3>1.3 About SDMX</h3>

<p>The Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX) Initiative
was organised in 2001 by seven international organisations (BIS,
ECB, Eurostat, IMF, OECD, World Bank and the UN) to
realise greater efficiencies in statistical practice. These organisations all
collect significant amounts of data, mostly from the national level,
to support policy. They also disseminate data at the supra-national
and international levels.</p>

<p>
There have been several important results from this work: two
versions of a set of technical specifications - ISO:TS 17369
(SDMX) - and the release of several recommendations for
structuring and harmonising cross-domain statistics, the SDMX
Content-Oriented Guidelines. All of the products are available at
<a href="http://www.sdmx.org">www.sdmx.org</a>. 
The standards are now being widely adopted
around the world for the collection, exchange, processing, and
dissemination of aggregate statistics by official statistical
organisations. The UN Statistical Commission recommended
SDMX as the preferred standard for statistics in 2007.
</p>

<p>The SDMX specification defines a core <em>information model</em> 
which is reflected in concrete form in two syntaxes - SDMX-ML (and XML syntax) and SDMX-EDI.
SDMX-RDF builds up that same SDMX information model, showing how to expressing the same information
in RDF form.</p>

<p>A key component of the SDMX standards package are
the <strong>Content-Oriented Guidelines</strong> (COGs), a set of
cross-domain concepts, code lists, and categories that support
interoperability and comparability between datasets by providing a
shared language between SDMX implementors. RDF versions of these
artefacts are available as part of SDMX-RDF, and should be re-used
whenever possible. Throughout the sections of this document, resources
from the COGs will be mentioned when available.</p>


<h3>1.4 Relationship to SCOVO</h3>

<p>The Statistical Core Vocabulary (SCOVO) [@@ref] is a lightweight
RDF vocabulary for expressing statistical data. Its relative
simplicity allows easy adoption by data producers and consumers, and
it can be combined with other RDF vocabularies for greater effect. The
model is extensible both on the schema and the instance level for more
specialized use cases.</p>

<p>While SCOVO addresses the basic use case of expressing statistical
data in RDF, its minimalist design is limiting, and it does not
support important scenarios that occur in statistical publishing, such
as:</p>

<ul>
<li>definition and publication of the structure of a dataset independent from concrete data,</li>
<li>data flows which group together datasets that share the same
structure, for example from different national data providers,</li>
<li>definition of "slices" through a dataset, such as an individual
time series or cross-section, for individual annotation,</li>
<li>distinctions between dimensions, attributes and measures.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The design of SDMX-RDF is informed by SCOVO,
and every SCOVO dataset can be re-expressed as an SDMX-RDF dataset.
</p>

<h3>1.5 Statistical data as a hypercube</h3>

<p>A statistical data set comprises a collection of observations made
at some points across a logical space. The set can be characterized by
a set of dimensions that define what the observation applies to (time,
area, population) along with metadata describing what has been
measured (e.g. economic activity), how it was measured and how the
observations are expressed (e.g. units, multipliers, status).  We thus
think of the statistical space as a hyper-cube or multi-dimensional
space indexed by those dimensions. This concept of a <em>cube</em> of
data is a common way to describe and think of such statistical
datasets.</p>

<h3>1.6 Audience and scope</h3>

<p>This document describes the vocabulary for SDMX-RDF and how it
relates to the SDMX model. It is aimed at people wishing to publish
statistical data in RDF but does not assume that the data is already
available in SDMX. Mechanics of cross-format translation from other
SDMX formats to SDMX-RDF will be covered elsewhere.</p>

<p>The scope for SDMX-RDF itself is to enable publication of
statistics as linked data using RDF. While we can regard it is a third
syntax for the SDMX information model it is not aimed at complete
round-tripping to other SDMX formats, though it might be extended to
support that in the future.</p>


<h3>1.7 Document conventions</h3>

<p>
The names of RDF entities -- classes, predicates, instances, etc -- are
URIs. These are usually expressed using a compact notation where the
name is written <code>prefix:localname</code>, where the <code>prefix</code>
identifies a <i>namespace URI</i> which is to be prepended to the 
<code>localname</code> to obtain the full URI.
</p>

<p>
In this document we shall use the conventional prefix names for the
<a href="#namespaces-used-appendix">well-known namespaces</a>:

<ul>
  <li><code>rdf, rdfs</code> -- the core RDF namespaces</li>
  <li><code>dc</code> -- Dublin Core</li>
  <li><code>skos</code> -- Simple Knowledge Organization System</li>
  <li><code>foaf</code> -- Friend Of A Friend</li>
  <li><code>void</code> -- Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets</li>
  <li><code>scovo</code> -- Statistical Core Vocabulary</li>
</ul>

We also introduce the prefix <code>sdmx</code> for the SDMX-RDF namespace
(yet to be formally allocated). While the new terms required to express
SDMX concepts in RDF could have been added to the SCOVO namespace, it
seems more appropriate to emphasise their relationship with the 
standard they are taken from.

<p>This paper is based on the collaboration that was initiated in a workshop Publishing statistical datasets in SDMX and the semantic web hosted by ONS in Sunningdale, United Kingdom in February 2010. The completion of a draft reference model was one of several recommendations made by the participants, and this ongoing work continues in an open collaborative environment .  Taken together with the proposed collaboration to create a recommended style for URI design for use in APIs to find, obtain and query statistical data , we believe this work represents a key step towards bringing the worlds of linked data and official statistics together through the wider adoption of open standards.
